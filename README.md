# gj-download

A cli application for downloading geometry dash levels!

## How to use

You can also use `--help`

There are 3 parameters, `--level`, `--output` and `--dont-decrypt`.<br>
The ``--level`` is the level id to download, and ``--dont-decrypt`` is very self explanatory and isn't required, if you still didn't get it, it stops the application from decrypting the level data.<br><br>
You have to specify where the level is saved using ``--output``.
