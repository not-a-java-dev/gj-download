# gj-download

A cli application for downloading geometry dash levels!

## How to use

There are 2 parameters, `--level` and `--dont-decrypt`.<br>
The ``--level`` is the level id to download, and ``--dont-decrypt`` is very self explanatory and isn't required, if you still didn't get it, it stops the application from decrypting the level data.<br><br>
After running the application with the parameters there should be a `level.txt` file where you ran the command.
